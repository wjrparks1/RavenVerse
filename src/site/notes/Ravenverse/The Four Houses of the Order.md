## Overview

The Order of the Sons of Light operates through four primary headquarters strategically located across the globe. These houses serve as the main arteries of communication and command for the worldwide organization dedicated to hunting vampires and lilins.

## The Four Houses

### House of Scutum Fidei (Rome)

**Pronunciation:** _SKOO-tum FI-day-ee_  
**Location:** Rome, Italy  
**Status:** Main Headquarters and Nucleus

The House of Scutum Fidei serves as the primary headquarters of The Order. This is where the leaders of the Sons of Light, Knights Templar, Knights of the Shield, and Churiphim gather to discuss missions and establish laws. As the Core Order's central hub, all major decisions and strategic planning originate from this location.

### House of Spiritus Sanctus

**Pronunciation:** _SPEE-ree-tus SANK-tus_  
**Status:** Second Largest House  
**Primary Function:** Training and Preparation

The House of Spiritus Sanctus focuses on combat training and survival instruction for new members of The Order. As the second largest house, it serves as the primary training facility where recruits are drilled in the skills necessary to face supernatural threats.

### House of Pater

**Pronunciation:** _PAH-ter_  
**Location:** Asia  
**Status:** Regional Ruling House

The House of Pater serves as the ruling house for all Asian territories, coordinating Order activities across the continent and maintaining regional command structure.

### House of Filius

**Pronunciation:** _FEE-lee-us_  
**Location:** New York City, USA  
**Status:** Regional Ruling House

The House of Filius governs North and South America, serving as the primary command center for all Order operations in the Americas.

## The Great Schism

At present time, a significant split has occurred between the House of Spiritus Sanctus and the House of Scutum Fidei, dividing The Sons of The Order of Light. This schism led to the formation of a new faction calling themselves **The Order of Hellsing**, named after the legendary hunter who eventually brought down Dracula.

## Organizational Structure

The houses function as the main communication and command network for the global organization. Vampire hunters, priests, and other Order members follow the strict hierarchy of command built around these houses. Members have infiltrated churches, government agencies, law enforcement, military branches, and even political structures of various countries.

Through this extensive web of communication and affiliations, The Order can effectively track and hunt down vampires and lilins while gathering intelligence on their powers and threat levels.

## The Core Order

The Core Order consists of:

- The Pope
- Main leaders of the four houses
- Commanders of the Knights Templar and Knights of the Shield
- Archbishops from each region
- Aeons that command the four global regions
- Leaders from the Bavarian Illuminati and Freemasons

## Historical Purpose

The Order was established after the great flood and the destruction of the Nephilim. Their primary mission is to destroy the children of Lilith and eventually eliminate the children of Dracula. The organization has evolved from its ancient origins to become a modern, technologically advanced force against supernatural threats.

## Global Membership

Worldwide, the Order of the Sons of Light maintains approximately **33,000 members**, including [[Ravenverse/The Churiphim\|the Churiphim]]. These members work tirelessly to hunt down lilins and vampires, and are occasionally called upon to investigate and intervene in other paranormal activities when deemed genuine and dangerous.
