The Prophecy is an ancient prediction that serves as one of the central driving forces in the Hidden World series, representing hope for redemption and salvation for all undead beings cursed to vampirism or lilin existence.

## Origins and Antiquity

**Age:** The prophecy was made **thousands of years before Christ**, making it one of the oldest supernatural predictions in the Hidden World.

**Source:** The prophecy was **written on ancient scrolls** that Elspet discovered in ages past. These scrolls contained the original text, though parts have been damaged or "ruined" over the millennia.

**Discovery:** Elspet, in her thousands of years of existence, came across these ancient scrolls and has been one of the few beings to study and understand their contents.

## The Prophetic Vision

### Core Prediction

The prophecy foretells the coming of **a vampire with the power to end undead existence** - specifically, **the power to reverse the curse** that binds vampires and lilins to their supernatural state.

### The Chosen One's Characteristics

According to the prophecy, this savior vampire will possess specific, identifiable traits:

- **Black hair** (repeatedly emphasized as a key identifier)
- **Detests feeding on humans** (morally opposed to harming innocents)
- **Protects humans** (actively defends them from supernatural threats)
- **Shuns her own kind** (stands apart from vampire/lilin society)
- **Will be hunted by all** (faces persecution from both supernatural and human factions)

### The Scope of Salvation

The prophecy speaks of **"salvation for those once touched by the demon embrace"** - indicating that the cure would extend to:

- All vampires (descendants of Dracula's curse)
- All lilins (descendants of Lilith's curse)
- Potentially freeing them from eternal damnation

## Dual Nature: Salvation or Destruction

The prophecy contains a crucial ambiguity that makes it both hopeful and terrifying:

**The Power Could Either:**

- **Cure vampires and lilins** - reversing their undead curse and allowing them to become human again
- **Destroy all vampires and lilins** - completely eradicating the undead from existence

This duality means the prophesied figure could be either the ultimate savior or the ultimate destroyer of the undead races.

## Requirements for Fulfillment

### Personal Growth

- **"The vampire in question must grow into the powers"** - the abilities are not instant but develop over time
- **"Learn to control them"** - mastery and restraint are essential to properly wielding these abilities
- The prophesied vampire must mature both in power and wisdom before the prophecy can be fulfilled

### Damaged Knowledge

- **"Parts of the prophecy were ruined"** - crucial details about how the power works or what triggers its activation have been lost to time
- This missing information adds uncertainty about exactly how the salvation/destruction will occur

## Current Believers and Interpretations

### Elspet's Hope

Elspet represents the prophecy's most devoted believer, driven by deeply personal motivations:

- **Hannah's Salvation:** Elspet sees the prophecy as the only hope to free her daughter from the lilin curse she placed upon her
- **Personal Redemption:** The prophecy represents a chance to undo the "worst thing" she ever did to Hannah
- **Protective Vigilance:** Elspet carefully watches over potential candidates, particularly Raven

### Raven as the Candidate

Multiple characters believe Raven fits the prophetic description:

- **Physical Match:** Black hair, as specified
- **Moral Compass:** Refuses to feed on innocents, protects humans
- **Supernatural Abilities:** Can wield holy weapons (machairas) without harm
- **Social Position:** Hunted by both the Order and vampires, shuns vampire society
- **Unique Powers:** Stronger than typical fledgling vampires, suggesting special destiny

### Skepticism and Doubt

- **Raven's Denial:** "I am no savior of vampires" - she rejects the role
- **Dumitru's Caution:** Sees the prophecy as potentially dangerous to vampires
- **General Disbelief:** Many dismiss it as fantasy or wishful thinking

## Strategic Implications

### For Vampire/Lilin Society

- **Hope vs. Fear:** Some see salvation, others see extinction
- **Political Ramifications:** Could unite or fracture undead factions
- **Power Struggles:** Various leaders might try to control or eliminate the prophesied figure

### For The Order of the Sons of Light

- **Potential Weapon:** Could be used against all undead
- **Theological Questions:** Challenges their mandate if vampires can be redeemed
- **Strategic Uncertainty:** Unclear whether to support or oppose the prophecy's fulfillment

### For Individual Characters

- **Elspet:** Willing to risk everything to protect the prophecy's fulfillment for Hannah's sake
- **Raven:** Struggles with the burden of potentially being "chosen"
- **Other Undead:** Must decide whether to hope for cure or fear destruction

## Mysteries and Unknowns

### Unanswered Questions

- **How exactly would the cure/destruction work?**
- **What triggers the prophetic powers?**
- **Can the power be controlled to choose salvation over destruction?**
- **Are there other potential candidates besides Raven?**
- **What were the "ruined" portions of the original scrolls?**

### Future Implications

The prophecy suggests a **"far future"** where the cure becomes reality, indicating:

- The fulfillment may not happen immediately
- Multiple generations might be affected
- The supernatural world could be fundamentally transformed

## Significance to the Series

The Prophecy serves as:

- **Central Motivation** for Elspet's character arc and her protection of both Hannah and Raven
- **Source of Conflict** between various factions who interpret it differently
- **Symbol of Hope** for redemption in a world of supernatural curses
- **Driving Force** for major plot developments and character relationships
- **Unifying Theme** that connects the fate of humans, vampires, and lilins

## Theological and Philosophical Implications

The prophecy raises profound questions about:

- **Redemption:** Can supernatural curses be forgiven and reversed?
- **Free Will vs. Destiny:** Is Raven bound by fate or can she choose her path?
- **The Nature of Evil:** Are vampires inherently damned or victims of circumstance?
- **Sacrifice:** What price must be paid for universal salvation?

The Prophecy ultimately represents the series' exploration of whether supernatural beings cursed by ancient powers can find redemption, salvation, and a return to humanity - or whether they are doomed to eternal darkness and damnation.
