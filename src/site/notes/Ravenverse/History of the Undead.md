## Original Historical Records

### Internal Structure and Blood

Within the first hour of drinking blood, vampires feel warm to the touch, just like living humans. This occurs because several crucial changes happen to the body's internal structure during vampiric transformation.

The esophagus develops microscopic openings that absorb fresh blood like a sponge, delivering it directly to the heart. While the heart no longer beats continuously, it will activate when receiving a fresh supply of blood.

The heart pumps this blood throughout the body until every vein is filled, causing the vampire to feel warm like a living human. Some vampires continue feeding beyond this point, storing excess blood in the stomach for later use.

Once blood fills the previously empty veins, the vampire's tissue absorbs and uses it for replenishment, then the heart stops pumping. This circulation process can take an hour or more. Since the heart stops and blood ceases circulating, the vampire gradually returns to feeling cold.

#### Blood Abilities

Vampires can only feed on human blood—animal blood will not sustain them. This restriction stems from the curse inherited through both Lilith and Dracula.

Newly created vampires must feed every three nights or decomposition will consume their tissue. This feeding requirement gradually decreases over the first century of unlife. Blood grants vampires regenerative abilities, superhuman strength, speed, and various supernatural powers. Eventually, vampires can sustain themselves for weeks between feedings, while the oldest vampires can survive months without blood.

Lilins, being thousands of years older than vampires, typically go months without feeding. However, newly created lilins must feed every few days during their first year, though they can soon extend this to a month between feedings. This extended feeding schedule helps keep human suspicion low and allows deaths to blend into natural mortality rates.

All vampires have the potential to develop unique individual powers upon transformation. Blood enables abilities such as ESP, flight, shape-shifting, weather control, and animal command. However, gaining these unique powers is extremely rare, occurring almost exclusively among first and second-generation vampires directly descended from Dracula.

Lilins possess far more potent abilities due to their ancient heritage. Even newly created lilins typically manifest some of these powers immediately. Most lilin fledglings must remain with their creator for at least a year to master control and learn lilin law.

#### Sexual Feeding

Vampires and lilins require more than blood to survive—they must also nourish their mental and spiritual essence. Both basic needs of blood and sexual energy must be satisfied for proper function. While blood sustains the physical body, sexual energy feeds the mind and the dark essence that prevents vampires from degenerating into mindless, feral beasts.

Though sexual feeding isn't required as frequently as blood consumption, vampires and lilins who abstain from sexual energy for too long will eventually experience severe psychological breakdown, including delusions, uncontrollable rage, and complete detachment from reality.

### Creation of Lilins

Lilith, the mother of the Lilim ("night-demons"), became the first of her kind when she abandoned the Garden of Eden.

After leaving Eden, Lilith mated with fallen angels and bore children. When three angels of God came to retrieve her for Adam, they threatened to destroy her offspring if she refused to return. Since Lilith had been created immortal, they could not threaten her with death. When Lilith refused their demand, war erupted between the Lilim and humanity.

Lilith's daughters began seducing men with lustful temptation, feeding on their blood and the blood of their children. Demons soon joined forces with the Lilim, prompting the Archangels to summon an army led by Michael to destroy them.

Unable to control the daughter who had started the war, Lilith feared for her remaining children's lives. Using her seductive powers, she secured help from the angel Samael.

Samael mated with Lilith and promised to grant their children immortality, though they would be cursed with an eternal hunger for blood and forced to dwell in darkness forever. Viewing this as betrayal, Lilith attacked Samael, who retaliated by cursing her with undead existence. However, honoring their pact, he left her with the ability to create children—but only through her bite.

Lilith became the first blood drinker and, in her rage, created many lilins. Michael then led the Sons of Light against the Army of Darkness, which included demons, lilims, and lilins. The dark army was utterly destroyed, leaving only a handful of lilins who were subsequently hunted by humans.

Unable to bear the sorrow of losing her children, Lilith vanished from the world.

The surviving lilins learned to hide in darkness and use their powers to prey upon humans. Over the centuries, their reputation spread, eventually leading to the formation of an organization known as the Order of the Sons of Light.

These ancient lilins were incredibly powerful, terrorizing villages for centuries. They commanded weather and animals, could transform into mist or become invisible, and possessed abilities beyond human comprehension.

Most ancient lilins lived solitary existences, but vampire hunters gradually learned their weaknesses and began systematically destroying them. Eventually, supposedly all the ancient lilins were eliminated, leaving only weaker fledglings who lacked their predecessors' immense power, making them easier targets for hunters.

Just when it seemed the world might be free of lilins forever, in 1431 a man named Dracula made a pact with Lucifer. Dracula renounced God and joined with Lucifer, who granted him incredible dark powers. He could move faster than the eye could track, tear humans apart effortlessly, and showed resistance to sunlight. He could absorb memories through blood, hypnotize victims, and phase through solid walls. His shape-shifting abilities included transforming into bats, insects, demon dogs, masses of living darkness, and various humanoid forms.

With Dracula's rise, the name "Lilin" faded from common usage, replaced by the term "vampire."

### The Lilins

Contrary to what the Order believed, the lilins did not face near-extinction. Many had retreated to underground cities they constructed using their supernatural powers and intelligence. Human territories were divided among lilin rulers—princes and princesses descended from Lilith's direct bloodline. These royals answered to the strongest descendants: those created by Lilith herself and her daughter. This ruling council became known as the Blood Conclave when they assembled to discuss lilin law. Among its members, King Martialis holds supreme power as the oldest lilin created directly by Lilith.

All other Blood Conclave members were created by either Lilith's daughter or other second-generation offspring.

**Children of Lilith's daughter:**

- Avilius
- Amon
- Ashster
- Masha
- Aurera

**Second generation offspring:**

- Marius
- Athothes
- Amset
- Isi-em-chev
- Nuru
- Ankhta

From these bloodlines descended the various lilin princes and princesses who rule human territories worldwide. The global lilin population numbers approximately 150,000, concentrated primarily in the Old World—Europe, Africa, and Asia. Since lilins can survive months between feedings, the princes maintain this population as the maximum sustainable number for new creations.

Newly created lilins are inherently stronger and typically manifest powers immediately, unlike fledgling vampires. Lilins remain highly selective about whom they transform, being both ancient and far more powerful than vampires. Their transformation process is extremely exclusive.

King Martialis seeks to enslave the human population living outside the underground cities, where humans are already treated as livestock and sexual slaves. These subterranean cities maintain technological advancement through lilin scientists who develop new innovations in science and weaponry. Selected humans receive privileges and may even be offered lilin transformation if deemed worthy, but the majority remain as slaves—kept nude and subjected to experiments or torture by crueler lilins. Other humans serve as living blood banks, kept alive but regularly drained to fill reservoirs that feed the undead population.

War has been brewing against the newer undead—the vampires of the New World, particularly North and South America.

### The Vampires

Vampires, also known as the children of Tepes (Dracula), represent a new breed of undead that emerged in the 1400s. Initially, the Order mistook them for lilins, but after decades of study, they recognized vampires as a distinct species. The term "vampire" eventually became the dominant name for this new undead type.

Vampires spread rapidly, primarily through Dracula's three wives. While most of today's vampire population descends from these three brides, Dracula himself directly transformed only seven humans.

**Dracula's lineage and their offspring:**

- Jonas → Sala Walker ([[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]])
- Dumitru → Mariana → Damian → Andreea
- Zephyr → Mirela → Zane → 200+ descendants
- Constanta → 400+ descendants
- Atanasia → 50+ descendants
- Clara → 500+ descendants
- Lucie

Currently, the vampire population numbers around 100,000—a dramatic decline from their peak of 300,000. This reduction stems from vampires being the physically weaker undead species and intensive hunting by the Order. While some isolated vampire clusters remain in South America, keeping to themselves, the approaching war between vampires and lilins has forced the remaining elder vampires to prepare for invasion.

Sala Walker ([[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]) eliminated the strongest elders, Jonas and Zephyr. Dumitru died during the American Revolution, which left Damien as another remaining elder alongside [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] and approximately one hundred others descended from the Brides. The Order successfully destroyed most true elders, with [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] hunting down many others.

The Brides of Dracula have been missing since Dracula's destruction. Damien has searched extensively for them without success. Supposedly, only [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] and Damien remain as true elders, creating opportunities for lesser elders to assume leadership roles. Rumors occasionally surface of true elders appearing in major cities worldwide, but likely fearing the Order, they quickly vanish back into the shadows, choosing to remain isolated from vampire society.

True elders typically control multiple powers along with superior strength and speed, while lesser elders possess only one power alongside enhanced physical abilities that, while superior to normal vampires, remain less potent than true elders' capabilities.

Due to the coming war with both lilins and the Order, surviving vampires have united the remaining lesser elders into a government structure. The Elder Circle serves as the ruling body of lesser elders, creating new laws designed to strengthen vampire power. Learning from human organizational methods, vampires have established their own military forces equipped with modern weapons. Los Angeles has become their primary stronghold, with new breeding strategies implemented to increase vampire numbers. New York still hosts significant vampire populations, but they face pressure from both the Order and invading lilins. Most major battles occur there, prompting New York vampires to establish new laws and prince leaders to manage the crisis.

Since vampires represent the weaker undead species, with only true elder vampires possessing power equal to lilins—and only [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] and Damien remain among these elders, along with the missing Brides of Dracula—they must develop innovative strategies and leverage technology to combat their enemies. They have forged an alliance with a third undead breed: the nosferatu. Both species hate lilins and seek their destruction, making the nosferatu formidable war allies.

Nosferatu lack supernatural powers beyond enhanced physical abilities, but their physical capabilities are extraordinary. They maintain their own underground cities with human blood pools and slaves, and have achieved significant technological advancement. Nosferatu employ specialized combat suits that protect against churiphim powers and modern human weapons including firearms and bladed weapons. These undead function as exceptionally lethal warriors with expertise in multiple weapon systems and hand-to-hand combat—essentially modern-day ninjas.
