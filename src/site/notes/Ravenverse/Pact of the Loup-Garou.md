## Overview

The **Pact of the Loup-Garou** is a supernatural alliance formed after the Great Flood between lycanthropes (lycans) and pagans. This pact created a mystical veil to protect lycans from detection by the undead while establishing lycans as protectors of the Earth against supernatural threats.

## Historical Background

### The Genesis of the Pact

Following the Great Flood, the world's supernatural landscape shifted dramatically. The Loup-Garou, recognizing the growing threat posed by the undead and fallen entities, sought protection through alliance rather than continued isolation.

### Formation of the Alliance

The pact emerged from necessity between two former adversaries:

- **The Loup-Garou**: Ancient lycanthropes seeking concealment from undead predators
- **The Pagans**: Practitioners of old magic who required physical protection
- **The Catalyst**: Mutual recognition that cooperation offered survival advantages neither could achieve alone

### From Enemies to Allies

The relationship between lycans and pagans had been marked by centuries of hostility and territorial disputes. However, the escalating threat from supernatural forces—particularly the undead and demonic entities—forced both groups to reconsider their animosity. The pagans possessed the mystical knowledge to create protective barriers, while the lycans offered unmatched physical prowess as guardians. This pragmatic alliance transformed ancient enemies into steadfast protectors of one another.

### The Sacred Compact

The pact established dual obligations: lycans would serve as Earth's protectors against the undead, demons, and evil spirits that sought to corrupt and destroy the natural world, while pagans would maintain the mystical veil concealing lycan existence from their supernatural enemies. This arrangement allowed both groups to focus on their strengths while compensating for their individual vulnerabilities.

## The Mystical Veil

### Nature of the Protective Barrier

The cornerstone achievement of the pact manifests as an extraordinary supernatural veil woven through ancient pagan magic. This mystical barrier operates on multiple levels of reality, creating an impenetrable shield around lycan existence.

### Mechanism of Concealment

The veil functions by:

- **Mind Piercing**: Actively penetrating the consciousness of undead beings
- **Memory Erasure**: Completely removing any trace, memory, or awareness of lycans
- **Perception Blocking**: Preventing undead from detecting lycan presence through supernatural senses
- **Cognitive Blind Spots**: Creating mental barriers that redirect undead attention away from lycan activities

### Protective Coverage

This mystical shield extends its protection to:

- **All lycan forms** - Whether in human, animal, or transitional states
- **Lycan territories** - Sacred lands and pack domains
- **Mixed communities** - Areas where lycans interact with humans
- **Historical evidence** - Traces of past lycan activities become invisible to undead perception

### Limitations and Vulnerabilities

While incredibly powerful, the veil requires:

- **Constant maintenance** by skilled pagans
- **Mutual cooperation** between lycans and their pagan allies
- **Respect for pact obligations** by both parties
- **Protection from disruption** by hostile supernatural forces

## Sacred Duties and Responsibilities

### Guardians of the Natural World

Under the terms of the pact, lycans accepted the sacred responsibility of serving as Earth's primary defenders against supernatural corruption. This duty encompasses protection against multiple categories of threats that seek to harm or corrupt the natural order.

### Primary Adversaries

#### The Undead Threat

Vampires and lilins represent a constant danger to both human and natural ecosystems:

- **Ecological disruption** through uncontrolled feeding and territory corruption
- **Spiritual contamination** that spreads beyond their immediate presence
- **Human population exploitation** that threatens the balance of life

#### Demonic Manifestations

Unlike the undead, demons and evil spirits present unique challenges:

- **Possession capabilities** allowing them to inhabit human and animal hosts
- **Reality corruption** that warps natural laws and processes

#### Fallen Entities

Ancient beings of corruption seek to:

- **Establish footholds** in the physical realm
