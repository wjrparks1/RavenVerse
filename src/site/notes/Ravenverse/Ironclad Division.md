**Ironclad** is the most secretive division within the United States government's Transhuman Initiative, specializing in the genetic fusion of human and animal DNA to create enhanced warriors. Operating at an even higher classification level than other transhuman departments, Ironclad represents the cutting edge of biological warfare and human enhancement through animal genetics.

## Classification and Secrecy

### **Security Level**

- **Classification**: Beyond Top Secret - Compartmentalized above [[Ravenverse/DTO\|DTO]] and [[Ravenverse/EMO\|EMO]] levels
- **Access**: Extremely limited, even within the transhuman community
- **Knowledge**: Unknown to most personnel in other transhuman departments
- **Oversight**: Reports to the highest levels of shadow government

### **Operational Security**

- **Location**: Undisclosed secure facilities
- **Personnel**: Hand-selected scientists and military operatives
- **Research**: Conducted in complete isolation from other programs
- **Information Sharing**: Minimal cooperation with sister departments

## Research Focus and Methodology

### **Animal-Human Genetic Integration**

Ironclad's primary mission involves the combination of human DNA with various animal species to create enhanced soldiers with bestial capabilities:

#### **Potential Animal Sources**

Based on historical precedent and mythological references, Ironclad likely researches:

- **Predatory Mammals**: Lions, tigers, wolves, bears for enhanced strength and predatory instincts
- **Flying Species**: Birds of prey for potential aerial capabilities and enhanced vision
- **Marine Life**: Sharks, dolphins for aquatic operations and sensory enhancement
- **Reptilian Species**: Snakes, crocodiles for stealth and environmental adaptation
- **Exotic Animals**: Potentially including captured supernatural creatures

#### **Enhancement Goals**

- **Physical Augmentation**: Superhuman strength, speed, and endurance
- **Sensory Enhancement**: Animal-level hearing, smell, and night vision
- **Specialized Abilities**: Unique capabilities based on animal characteristics
- **Environmental Adaptation**: Enhanced survival in various terrains and conditions

### **Historical Context**

The division's work echoes ancient experiments described in supernatural lore:

#### **Mythological Precedents**

- **Fallen Angel Experiments**: Historical accounts of pre-flood genetic manipulation
- **Transhuman Creation**: Ancient beings that combined human and animal genetics
- **Mythical Creatures**: Origins of legendary beasts through genetic experimentation
- **Nephilim Connection**: Possible recreation of antediluvian genetic combinations

## Relationship to Other Departments

### **Interdepartmental Hierarchy**

Despite being part of the broader Transhuman Initiative, Ironclad operates independently:

#### **[[Ravenverse/DTO\|DTO]] ([[Ravenverse/DTO\|Department of Transhuman Operations]])**

- **Parallel Research**: Both focus on human enhancement but through different means
- **Resource Competition**: Likely rivalry for funding and recognition
- **Information Barriers**: Limited knowledge sharing due to security protocols
- **Success Comparison**: Unknown if Ironclad has achieved [[Ravenverse/DTO\|DTO]]-level success

#### **[[Ravenverse/EMO\|EMO]] ([[Ravenverse/EMO\|Elite Missions Operations]])**

- **Operational Support**: Potential deployment of Ironclad subjects through [[Ravenverse/EMO\|EMO]]
- **Field Testing**: [[Ravenverse/EMO\|EMO]] could provide real-world testing scenarios
- **Command Structure**: Uncertain integration between departments
- **Mission Coordination**: Likely compartmentalized to prevent information leaks

### **Secrecy from Sister Programs**

- **Agent Crowe's Ignorance**: Even high-level [[Ravenverse/EMO\|EMO]] personnel unaware of Ironclad
- **[[Ravenverse/DTO\|DTO]] Isolation**: Limited knowledge among transhuman departments
- **Information Compartmentalization**: Strict need-to-know basis
- **Security Protocols**: Advanced measures to prevent discovery

## Theoretical Capabilities and Applications

### **Enhanced Soldier Profiles**

Based on animal characteristics, Ironclad subjects might possess:

#### **Predator-Enhanced Soldiers**

- **Feline Integration**: Enhanced reflexes, night vision, stealth capabilities
- **Canine Fusion**: Superior tracking, pack coordination, loyalty enhancement
- **Ursine Modification**: Massive strength, endurance, hibernation abilities
- **Lupine Enhancement**: Pack mentality, enhanced senses, territorial instincts

#### **Specialized Operatives**

- **Aquatic Warriors**: Marine animal DNA for underwater operations
- **Aerial Reconnaissance**: Bird DNA for enhanced vision and spatial awareness
- **Desert Operations**: Reptilian adaptations for extreme environment survival
- **Arctic Missions**: Cold-weather animal traits for polar operations

### **Potential Advantages Over Other Programs**

- **Diverse Enhancement Options**: Multiple animal species provide varied capabilities
- **Environmental Specialization**: Tailored enhancement for specific mission parameters
- **Biological Compatibility**: Animal DNA may integrate more naturally than alien genetics
- **Renewable Resources**: Access to terrestrial genetic material

## Scientific and Ethical Considerations

### **Research Challenges**

- **Genetic Compatibility**: Ensuring stable integration of animal and human DNA
- **Behavioral Control**: Managing animal instincts in enhanced subjects
- **Physical Stability**: Preventing mutation and biological breakdown
- **Psychological Effects**: Maintaining human consciousness and loyalty

### **Ethical Implications**

- **Human Rights**: Transformation of soldiers into hybrid beings
- **Consent Issues**: Voluntary vs. coerced participation in experiments
- **Identity Questions**: Psychological impact of animal integration
- **Societal Implications**: Integration of human-animal hybrids into society

### **Containment Concerns**

- **Rogue Subjects**: Risk of enhanced soldiers becoming uncontrollable
- **Breeding Potential**: Possibility of hybrid reproduction
- **Environmental Impact**: Escaped subjects affecting ecosystems
- **Public Exposure**: Catastrophic consequences if program revealed

## Operational Applications

### **Military Deployment**

- **Special Operations**: Enhanced soldiers for high-risk missions
- **Environmental Warfare**: Specialized troops for specific terrains
- **Reconnaissance**: Enhanced sensory capabilities for intelligence gathering
- **Psychological Warfare**: Intimidation factor of human-animal hybrids

### **Domestic Applications**

- **Border Security**: Enhanced guards for sensitive installations
- **Counter-Terrorism**: Specialized units for tracking and elimination
- **Law Enforcement**: Enhanced officers for high-crime areas
- **Emergency Response**: Rescue operations in dangerous environments

## Threats and Vulnerabilities

### **Internal Risks**

- **Subject Rebellion**: Animal instincts overriding human loyalty
- **Research Exposure**: Discovery by hostile intelligence services
- **Ethical Violations**: International law violations if exposed
- **Scientific Failures**: Catastrophic mutations or biological breakdowns

### **External Threats**

- **Supernatural Detection**: Possible identification by otherworldly entities
- **International Opposition**: Foreign government interference
- **Public Backlash**: Societal rejection if program becomes known
- **Religious Opposition**: Condemnation from various faith groups

### **Historical Parallels**
