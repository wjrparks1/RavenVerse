The Shanto are a **clandestine supernatural organization** that serves as a crucial force for protecting the innocent in the Hidden World series. They are distinguished by their use of **spiritual energy (chi)** as their primary source of power, setting them apart from other supernatural factions.

## Core Philosophy and Mission

**Primary Purpose:** The Shanto use their powers **"to battle the evil of the world"** and **"protect the innocent"** from supernatural threats.

**Operational Style:** As a **clandestine group**, they operate in secrecy, working behind the scenes to combat supernatural dangers while maintaining the masquerade that keeps the supernatural world hidden from regular humans.

## Power System: Spiritual Energy (Chi)

### Fundamental Difference from Other Factions

- **Churiphim and Witches:** Use external energy - "the energy around us, the elements of creation"
- **Shanto:** Use **"a spiritual power, an inner power"** - drawing from within themselves rather than external sources

### Chi Manifestations

The Shanto's spiritual energy appears as **golden/yellow glowing constructs** and can be shaped into various forms:

**Spirit Constructs:**

- **Spiritual weapons** (swords, whips, blades)
- **Spiritual entities** (animals like lions, tigers, bunnies)
- **Energy blasts** and projectiles
- **Protective shields**

**Combat Applications:**

- **Enhanced physical abilities** through chi augmentation
- **Spiritual weapon creation** for demon/undead combat
- **Animal spirit summoning** for assistance and protection
- **Energy projection** for ranged attacks

## Hierarchy and Power Levels

The Shanto operate on a **level-based system** that determines both authority and power capacity:

### Known Levels and Members

**Level 5 - "The True Shanto"**

- **Elissa Snow** - Blonde hair, blue eyes
- Highest known rank
- Appears to be the ultimate authority figure

**Level 3**

- **Arthur Hicks** - Brown hair, dark eyes
- **Abilities:** Spirit Constructs (Spiritual Whip Generation), Spirit Weapons, Spirit Entities, Bodily Attribute Augmentation
- Can summon complex spirit animals (lions named "Charlie", tigers, even "spiritual bunnies")
- Combat-capable against demons and supernatural threats

**Level 2**

- **Lisa Hicks** - Brown hair, dark eyes (Arthur's sister)
- **Abilities:** Spirit projection (energy blasts), Spirit Constructs (Spiritual Whip Generation, Spiritual Blades)
- More limited abilities than Level 3, focuses on energy projection and basic constructs

### Power Progression

- **Lower Levels:** Basic energy manipulation, simple constructs
- **Higher Levels:** Complex entity creation, advanced combat abilities, leadership roles
- **Level 5:** Presumably master-level abilities and organizational authority

## Training and Education

### Formal Education System

The Shanto maintain a structured educational program:

- **Mandatory Classes:** All Shanto must take "demonology class" to understand supernatural threats
- **Combat Training:** Practical application of chi abilities in battle scenarios
- **Theoretical Knowledge:** Study of demon hierarchies, supernatural politics, and threat assessment

### Recruitment and Development

- Members can advance through levels based on skill and dedication
- Training appears to include both theoretical study and practical combat experience
- Some members (like Arthur) seem more focused on practical application than academic study

## Organizational Structure and Culture

### Leadership

- **Elissa Snow (Level 5)** appears to be the supreme authority

### Limitations

- Power levels create clear hierarchies of capability

- Some members (like Arthur) may lack academic knowledge despite combat skills

## Historical Context

### Ancient Alliance

- Historical role as peacekeepers and protectors

### Modern Operations

## Significance in the Hidden World

The Shanto represent a crucial **third faction** in the supernatural world, serving as:

- **Spiritual Warriors:** Offering a chi-based alternative to angelic, demonic, or vampiric powers
- **Ancient Wisdom:** Maintaining centuries-old knowledge and practices
- **Neutral Force:** Operating independently while cooperating when necessary

Their unique **inner power system** and **protective mission** make them valuable allies and formidable opponents, representing the possibility that humans can develop supernatural abilities through spiritual discipline rather than curse, blessing, or corruption.
