**Elite Missions Operations (EMO)** is a classified black operations agency within the United States government that specializes in high-risk missions involving national security threats. The organization operates in the shadows, conducting operations that require extreme discretion and deniability. During the events of _[[Characters/Andreea Cohen\|Andreea]] The Undying_, the EMO becomes deeply involved in alien-human genetic experimentation and the cover-up of extraterrestrial threats.

- **Cover-Up Operations**: Suppression of incidents that could expose classified programs
- **Special Projects**: Involvement in experimental and highly classified government initiatives

### **Recruitment Criteria**

The EMO recruits the most elite military personnel:

- **Special Forces Background**: Army Rangers, Navy SEALs, Delta Force operators
- **Specialized Skills**: Snipers, demolitions experts, tactical specialists
- **Psychological Profile**: Ability to operate in morally ambiguous situations
- **Loyalty**: Unquestioning obedience to government authority

## The Transhuman Initiative

### **Multi-Department Collaboration**

The EMO works alongside several other classified departments:

#### **[[Ravenverse/DTO\|DTO]] ([[Ravenverse/DTO\|Department of Transhuman Operations]])**

- **Focus**: Angorian DNA research and human enhancement
- **Success**: Created Lt. Commander [[Characters/Lt. Commander Morrison\|Morrison]] and the upcoming Alpha Team
- **Leadership**: Leads the field in genetic enhancement research

#### **[[Ravenverse/Ironclad Division\|Ironclad]] Division**

- **Specialization**: Animal-based genetic engineering
- **Research**: Combination of human and animal DNA modifications
- **Classification**: Highly secretive, even within the transhuman community

### **Alien Research Programs**

The EMO oversees multiple extraterrestrial research initiatives:

#### **Species Classification**

- **[[Ravenverse/a1AlphaC\|a1AlphaC]]**: Aggressive alien species with rapid healing and reproduction capabilities
- **Angorian Species**: Feline-like aliens that crashed in the Amazon 20 years prior
- **Research Timeline**: Government knowledge of alien visitors dating back to the Eisenhower administration

#### **Genetic Splicing Projects**

- **Objective**: Creating enhanced human soldiers with alien abilities
- **Test Subjects**: Both voluntary military personnel and captured specimens
- **Results**: Varied success rates with significant casualties among failed subjects

## The Sanderson Incident

### **Mission Background**

What began as a routine extraction mission in West Texas escalated into a major containment crisis:

#### **Initial Objectives**

- **Target**: Dr. Kevin Alinsky, rogue scientist
- **Reason**: Theft of classified alien genetic material and research
- **Secondary Threat**: Alinsky's daughter Zoe, transformed into an alien hybrid

#### **Mission Complications**

- **Rogue Agent**: [[Characters/Andreea Cohen\|Andreea Cohen]] (The Lotus) went AWOL to protect civilians
- **Alien Outbreak**: Multiple a1 creatures escaped containment
- **Public Exposure**: Risk of civilian casualties and media attention

### **Cover-Up Operations**

- **Media Narrative**: Russian spy infiltration story
- **Witness Management**: Memory alteration and witness elimination
- **Evidence Suppression**: Cleanup crews removed all traces of alien involvement
- **Social Media Control**: Active monitoring and deletion of compromising posts

## Operational Methods

### **Standard Protocols**

- **No Authorities Involvement**: Operations conducted without local law enforcement knowledge
- **Extreme Prejudice**: Authorization to eliminate threats with lethal force
- **Collateral Damage**: Civilian casualties considered acceptable for mission success
- **Deniability**: No official government connection to EMO operations

### **Equipment and Resources**

- **Vehicles**: Black SUVs, helicopters (Black Hawks, Apaches)
- **Weapons**: Advanced military hardware, experimental technologies
- **Technology**: Mobile command centers, surveillance equipment, communication systems
- **Personnel**: Unlimited budget for recruitment and equipment acquisition

### **Containment Procedures**

- **Alien Specimens**: Capture and study of extraterrestrial biological entities
- **Test Subjects**: Human experimentation with micro-explosive failsafes
- **Research Facilities**: Secure locations for genetic experimentation
- **Disposal Methods**: Incineration and complete destruction of evidence

## Moral and Ethical Framework

### **Operational Philosophy**

- **National Security First**: Any action justified if it protects classified programs
- **End Justifies Means**: Civilian casualties acceptable for greater good
- **Absolute Secrecy**: No limits on methods to maintain operational security
- **Government Supremacy**: EMO authority supersedes all other law enforcement

### **Treatment of Assets**

- **Contractors**: Expendable resources for mission completion
- **Test Subjects**: Human experimentation with minimal ethical oversight
- **Civilians**: Potential threats to be neutralized if necessary
- **Whistleblowers**: Immediate termination for security breaches

## Technology and Science

### **Alien Technology Integration**

- **Reverse Engineering**: Study of recovered alien technology
- **Biological Weapons**: Development of alien-human hybrid soldiers
- **Medical Applications**: Alien healing abilities for human enhancement
- **Weapons Development**: Integration of alien capabilities into military hardware

### **Genetic Engineering Capabilities**

- **DNA Splicing**: Combination of alien and human genetic material
- **Mutation Control**: Micro-explosive implants for subject termination
- **Enhancement Programs**: Creating superhuman soldiers with alien abilities
- **Reproduction Studies**: Understanding alien reproduction cycles and preventing population explosions

## Threats and Vulnerabilities

### **Internal Threats**

- **Rogue Agents**: Operatives who develop moral objections to missions
- **Information Leaks**: Risk of public exposure through whistleblowers
- **Failed Experiments**: Containment breaches from genetic experimentation
- **Inter-Agency Conflicts**: Competition between different transhuman departments

### **External Threats**

- **Public Exposure**: Risk of alien existence becoming public knowledge
- **Foreign Intelligence**: Other nations seeking access to alien technology
- **Alien Retaliation**: Potential response from extraterrestrial civilizations
- **Supernatural Forces**: Conflicts with other hidden world organizations

## Legacy and Impact

### **Historical Significance**

The EMO represents the darkest aspects of government power when unchecked by oversight or moral constraints. Their willingness to sacrifice innocent lives for national security objectives demonstrates the corrupting influence of absolute secrecy and unlimited authority.

### **Connections to the Hidden World**

While primarily focused on alien threats, the EMO's existence puts them in potential conflict with other supernatural organizations:

- **Order of the Sons of Light**: Ancient vampire hunting organization
- **Vampire Communities**: Supernatural beings threatened by government research
- **Other Paranormal Entities**: Potential future targets for government control

### **Future Implications**

- **Alpha Team Deployment**: Second-generation transhumans with enhanced capabilities
- **Expanded Programs**: Additional alien species research and experimentation
- **Global Operations**: Potential for EMO expansion into international operations
- **Technological Advancement**: Integration of alien technology into broader military applications
