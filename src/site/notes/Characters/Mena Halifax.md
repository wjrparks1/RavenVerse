**Mena Halifax** is a powerful Churiphim warrior and former 2nd rank member of The Order of the Sons of Light. Following the schism within The Order, she now serves as the 1st rank commander of The Order of Hellsing, leading those Churiphim who followed her into the breakaway faction.

## Biography

### Early Life

Mena comes from one of the 40 blessed bloodlines that carry angelic blood. From birth, she was conditioned by her father to harbor deep hatred toward the undead and trained with brutal intensity to prepare for her destiny as a Churiphim. Her father's harsh training methods and eventual abandonment of her to The Order left deep emotional scars, creating feelings of abandonment that would later be suppressed when her angelic nature awakened.

### Training and Rise to Power

When Mena joined The Order of the Sons of Light and the Sisterhood of Churiphim, she found herself alone among strangers, with only fear and loneliness as companions. **[[Characters/Judith\|Judith]]**, the 1st rank Churiphim, became her trainer and mentor during this difficult period.

Driven by burning determination and an overwhelming need to become stronger, Mena fought her way up through the ranks over centuries of service. She became the third Churiphim to ever hold the prestigious title of 2nd rank, a position she maintained for over 300 years. Her rise to power was marked by exceptional combat prowess and an unwavering dedication to The Order's mission.

### The Schism

During the split between the House of Spiritus Sanctus and the House of Scutum Fidei, Mena made the decisive choice to break away from the traditional Order. She became the founding leader of **The Order of Hellsing**, named after the legendary figure who brought down Dracula, and now commands all Churiphim who followed her into this new faction.

## Personality

Mena is characterized by her robotic, emotionless demeanor—a result of her angelic nature suppressing her human emotions. She is utterly lethal in execution and laser-focused on her missions. Once given an objective, nothing can deter her from completing it. Her no-nonsense approach to warfare has made her a feared opponent, and it's said that no enemy has ever escaped a battle with her alive.

The emotional trauma of her father's abandonment was effectively sealed away when her angelic nature awakened, transforming her into the perfect warrior but at the cost of her humanity.

## Notable Feats

### Combat Achievements

- Single-handedly destroyed an entire army of vampires
- Has killed more Lilins than any other Churiphim except [[Characters/Judith\|Judith]]
- Engaged in combat with a Demon Prince, utilizing the most powerful spells in her arsenal
- Successfully held her ground against the Demon Prince until the veil between Hell and Earth closed, forcing the demon back to its realm

### Strategic Restraint

Unlike many Churiphim, Mena rarely relies on her elemental powers, having witnessed the dangerous consequences when Churiphim lose control. She has seen fellow warriors become crazed mutations of human, angel, and elemental creature when they push their elemental bonds too far. This wisdom has kept her powers stable and her mind intact.

## Affiliations

- **The Sisterhood of Churiphim** (former/current)
- **The Order of Hellsing** (current leader)

## Relationships

### [[Characters/Judith\|Judith]]

Mena's former trainer and mentor, [[Characters/Judith\|Judith]] remains the only Churiphim of higher rank. Despite their organizational separation following the schism, their shared history as trainer and student creates a complex dynamic between the two most powerful Churiphim.

## Legacy

Mena's name has become legendary among both vampires and Lilins, striking fear into the undead across the Hidden World. Her transition from abandoned child to supreme warrior exemplifies the tragic transformation that defines [[Ravenverse/The Churiphim\|the Churiphim]]—gaining incredible power at the cost of their humanity.

As the leader of The Order of Hellsing, Mena represents a new chapter in the war against the undead, commanding a faction that may prove to be even more ruthless and effective than the traditional Order from which it split.
