Leonette's family was one of the 40 chosen to carry the blood of angels through history. Since only females can become churiphim, her sister Aphilia, being the oldest, would have been the next in line to be chosen as a churiphim should the need have arisen. She also had two older brothers. For the most part they lived without direct involvement of the Order. While she loved all her siblings, Leonette had a close relationship with her sister; they would help mother with the chores around the house while the brothers would go with Father to help him. The family knew their history and the blood lineage from the angels. Some families choose to hide this from the children until a later time, but the Alrick family didn't hide their history from their children. Leonette knew of the things that lurked in the dark.

The year of her 8th birthday in 1756, her family was murdered by vampires in a coordinated effort by them to wipe out the family lines that held the blood of angels. Leonette was barely saved when her grandfather arrived to rescue her with a group of hunters from the Order. Enraged by the vampires that slaughtered her family, she sought to join the Order and the Sisterhood of Churiphim. The Order knew she was already too old, but with her grandfather pushing to get her in, and when the timing was correct when [[Ravenverse/The Churiphim\|the churiphim]] from her bloodline died, she was accepted. They moved her to Rome for training, where they kept the other trainees in an area of magical enchantment where they stopped aging as long as they remained within the barrier.

Starting at an older age, almost 9 years now, it took some time to train her mind and mold it so she would be ready with the angel half that would be awakened once the blood of the angel for her lineage was mixed with hers.

Leonette's mind had to be trained and emotions subdued to take on the phase of training that required her to discover her elemental affinity, which for her was the element of fire. For this, trainees suffered rigorous assaults on both mind and body. To strengthen their minds against what the undead enemies may do to them, trainees would be isolated for months, go through tests in freezing weather, be locked in cells as if they were captured by enemies and interrogated while nude. All this to break them down and rebuild them over and over. The ones that couldn't rise above the tests were usually sent away to work as other types of members of the Order, if they did not go mad from the training. The blood that had been fused with them by angels thousands of years ago separated them from other normal girls their age. Their minds were usually more mature at the age of 12 than most children, and the angel blood gave them the ability to withstand the mental training. The dormant angel within them gave them resistances and mental acuteness basically.

Once the mental fortitude was there and the human side subdued, the first phase to becoming a churiphim took place. She and her fellow churiphim trainees would go through a ritual that opened their mind and spirit to the elemental realm where entities existed that commanded the elements of the world. The elemental realm of fire was her destination during the ritual. Leonette's spiritual essence traveled to this realm and found one of the fire elementals, a creature that looked like a blazing fire in humanoid form with the chest and top of the shoulders down to the back of the arms made of glowing red rock.

Once she spoke the command word of power to merge with the elemental, a battle of the mind took place. Only the strongest trainees with mental fortitude won; the rest would succumb to the elemental's mind and become a mutated creature between elemental, angel and human. A creature that would run rampant in its crazed state and kill anything in its path using the full might of elemental powers and angel powers—an abomination.

Leonette won her mental battle and fused with the fire elemental, thus granting her the use of fire as if it were her own. She survived the phase, but Tiana, a trainee she'd become good friends with, had failed the mental battle and became an abomination, forming into a large winged and wet-skinned beast with a deformed body. Tiana's element had been water. [[Ravenverse/The Churiphim\|The Churiphim]] charged in to take the creature down; three churiphim were severely injured. Leonette watched her friend be killed.

It was hard to control her emotions, but to become a churiphim, she had to kill her human side. The final training came: the blood merging and awakening. First came the learning of the Aeons and ranks of churiphim.

The three male overseers, the Aeons, males similar to [[Ravenverse/The Churiphim\|the churiphim]], arrived for the final ritual. While females had a higher fortitude to control the power of angels without going mad, males had a lower level of success. The male tests were dangerous and trying. Very few survived, and only three Aeons existed at a time whose job was to subdue Churiphim powers. This created a safety net for any Aeons or Churiphim if they should go astray. The Aeons held the highest command, and only the first rank churiphim, which was [[Characters/Judith\|Judith]], was equal to them. As long as their powers were in check.

Aeons and Churiphim, along with the priests from the Order of the Sons of Light, commenced the chanting of the magical formula to call upon the powers of the angels and summon each angel of the particular lineage she was from.

After Leonette was blessed, she walked forth within the Chamber of Light. Inside she felt the divine power emanating from heavenly virtue. Fear and awe mixed within her as she moved forward to concentric circles drawn upon the floor with symbols of the 40 angels that [[Ravenverse/The Churiphim\|the churiphim]] were created from. Her lineage came from the angel Camael, and he appeared by the altar in the middle of the circles where heavenly light shot down like a golden ray, wings spread wide and bright. Camael took a small sickle from the altar and sliced his palm. Blood flowed from the cut and he poured it into a golden chalice. He waved Leonette over and she walked forth.

Camael took the chalice into his hands and blessed it. "With my blood I give command of my powers to you, and awaken your angelic half. Upon doing so, you are a champion for all that is good and holy. Let no evil go unpunished, and let those who are righteous go free. Do not use my powers for evil, for I shall come and claim you. Thus, with the drinking of this my blood, our pact is sealed."

Leonette took the chalice and drank. Her body burned and she screamed as the fire spread through her, transforming it, hair glowing silver and her eyes shooting light. When the pain subsided, Camael was gone. Her senses were enhanced; she could feel her strength, could see the particles of dust in the air, smell the scents of the room.

Leonette went through different tests after the transformation to gauge her power and skills, consisting of weapons, hand to hand, and elemental trials. She was the weakest and deemed the 40th ranked churiphim. Upon reaching her 23rd birthday, Leonette stopped aging as all churiphim do around their mid twenties. She went to work in the new world with her grandfather during the American Revolution. He was the only family she had left, besides the long distance family they never kept contact with—the ones that would be the survivors for the lineage.

In 1776, Leonette separated herself from The Sisterhood of Churiphim and The Order, choosing to side with [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] and seeking vengeance against [[Characters/Elspet\|Elspet]], the lilin that killed her grandfather. She never killed [[Characters/Elspet\|Elspet]], losing to her twice and almost dying if it were not for [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]. For 4 years after, Leonette remained with [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] and her brothers Mathew and Phillip, along with Nathaniel, [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]'s lover. She trained them in the ways of churiphim skills while they showed her a more human way of living and connecting. While she remained with [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]], she trained harder, increasing her powers and enhancing her skills. She wanted vengeance and she would seek [[Characters/Elspet\|Elspet]] again.

In 1880, [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] met up with a group of vampires that [[Characters/Elspet\|Elspet]] kept with. The opportunity presented itself once more for Leonette to kill [[Characters/Elspet\|Elspet]], but the lilin proved to be too powerful yet and almost killed her once more.

During an intense battle between [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]'s group of vampire friends and the highest ranked churiphim, Leonette was thought to have been killed. Surviving the battle, Leonette hid and adapted to the human world and secretly hunted vampires and criminals on her own. She took many guises, but finally settled as a detective over the decades, and helped humans where the law could not.

Leonette's extreme determination to become stronger has been a driving force throughout her life. Her sheer willpower was enough to accomplish what no other churiphim has. She allowed the elemental she was bonded with into another battle of mental fortitude and conquered it, forcing the fire elemental to yield to her commands. Instead of mutating and becoming a crazed beast, Leonette has the ability to call upon the power of fire without worry of reaching any limit, and thus has not yet known the extent she can take her fiery powers.

She has mainly resided in New York and Maine, hiding as a human private detective and using her churiphim abilities to solve cases relating to both paranormal and human matters.

Over the years, the Order hadn't searched her out anymore, but she knew if she'd run into them they would more than likely still try to exact some punishment for her betrayal 200 years ago. But she was not the same churiphim anymore.
