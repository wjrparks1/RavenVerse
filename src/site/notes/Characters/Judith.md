**Judith** is the 1st rank Churiphim of The Order of The Sons of Light and one of the most powerful beings in the Hidden World. As a half-angel, half-human hybrid, she serves as a crucial intermediary between the divine hierarchy and mortal realm in the ongoing war against the undead.

## Overview

**Real Name:** Judith  
**Height:** 6'4"  
**Weight:** 165 lbs  
**Species:** Churiphim (Half-Angel, Half-Human)  
**Rank:** 1st Rank Churiphim  
**Affiliation:** The Order of The Sons of Light, The Sisterhood of Churiphim  
**Status:** Active

## Background

Unlike other Churiphim who tend to be impassive, Judith possesses the unique ability to display human-like emotions and behavior. This exceptional trait makes her invaluable when dealing with political figures and human world affairs. She has operated behind the scenes of many countries throughout history and has influenced world outcomes on multiple occasions. The Order has strategically used her abilities to infiltrate the United Nations and obtain vital resources in their war against the undead.

Judith has maintained her prestigious 1st rank for over 5,000 years, making her one of the first generation Churiphim ever created. It is rumored that her angelic heritage comes from a Dominion—an angel from the second sphere in the celestial hierarchy—which accounts for her extraordinary power level among [[Ravenverse/The Churiphim\|the Churiphim]].

Her divine appointment comes directly from the Archangel Michael, who tasked her to serve as an intermediary between The Order of the Sons of Light and the heavenly host.
