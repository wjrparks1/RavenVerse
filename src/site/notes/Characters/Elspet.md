## Relationships

### Hannah (Daughter)

Elspet's most important relationship is with her daughter Hannah. She is deeply protective and loving toward the child, often worrying about dangers that might threaten her. Hannah sees Elspet as a hero and provides emotional grounding for the ancient lilin.

### [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] - The Prophesied Savior

Elspet has a deeply complex and significant relationship with the vampire [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]], who she believes may be the key to freeing her daughter Hannah from the lilin curse. Their relationship is built on multiple layers:

**The Ancient Prophecy:** Elspet believes in an ancient prophecy made thousands of years before Christ that foretells of a vampire who could reverse the undead curse - potentially offering salvation to those cursed with undead existence. [[Ravenverse/The Prophecy\|The prophecy]] describes "a vampire with the power to end the undead existence, the power to reverse the curse" - specifically one with black hair who "detests feeding on humans and protects them" and "shuns her own kind."

**Hope for Hannah:** Elspet has been searching for millennia for a cure to the curse she placed on Hannah to save her from death. She sees [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] as potentially fulfilling this prophecy, representing hope that Hannah could one day be freed from her eternal childhood and lilin nature.

**Protective Instincts:** This belief adds deeper meaning to Elspet's protective actions toward [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]], including the dramatic rescue from crucifixion and various battles where she saves [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] from danger. She's not just saving an ally - she's protecting what might be her daughter's only chance at salvation.

**Careful Observation:** Elspet has watched [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]'s development with great interest, noting her unique traits: immunity to holy weapons, ability to work with hunters, moral compass that prevents her from feeding on innocents, and her tendency to protect humans while fighting her own kind.

Despite their occasional conflicts when [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] tries to stop Elspet's more predatory activities, there's profound mutual respect between them, enhanced by Elspet's hope that [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] represents the future salvation of her daughter.

### Arthur and Lisa

Part of Elspet's extended network of allies who help protect innocents from supernatural threats.

### Allies and Enemies

- **Demons:** Primary antagonists who view her as a threat to their plans
- **Churiphim:** Half-angels who hunt supernatural creatures, including lilins
- **Vampires:** Complex relationships with other vampires, sometimes allies, sometimes adversaries

## Business Ventures

Elspet owns three successful strip clubs called "Naked Sins" across Los Angeles. She maintains high standards for her establishments and treats her dancers well, though she uses her supernatural charm abilities to enhance the clubs' success. She's known to:

- Only hire the most beautiful dancers
- Split earnings fairly with her employees
- Protect her dancers from abusive situations
- Maintain elegant, non-"cheap or cheesy" establishments

## Feeding Habits

As a lilin, Elspet requires both blood and sexual energy to survive:

- **Blood Feeding:** Must consume human blood regularly, though as an ancient lilin she can go longer periods between feedings than younger supernatural beings
- **Sexual Energy:** Feeds on sexual energy and arousal from humans
- **Selective Feeding:** Often chooses victims who are already in dangerous situations or who have committed harmful acts

## Enemies and Threats

### Demons

Elspet's primary enemies are demons who see her as a significant threat to their operations. She has battled demon princes and various classes of demons throughout her existence.

### Churiphim

Half-angels who hunt supernatural creatures view Elspet as a dangerous target due to her immense power and lilin nature. While she has defeated multiple high-ranking churiphim including [[Characters/Mena Halifax\|Mena]] and her forces, **Elspet is notably cautious about facing [[Characters/Judith\|Judith]], the first-rank churiphim**.

**Regarding [[Characters/Judith\|Judith]] specifically**: Elspet has never fought [[Characters/Judith\|Judith]] directly, and when discussing the presence of the first-rank churiphim, she warns that "We shall need to tread carefully with the witch roaming about." This unusual caution from someone who single-handedly defeated five high-ranking churiphim suggests that [[Characters/Judith\|Judith]] represents a level of threat that even Elspet takes seriously. Her careful approach stems from her need to protect Hannah and her hope that [[Ravenverse/The Prophecy\|the prophecy]] involving [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] will come to fruition - she cannot afford to take unnecessary risks that might prevent her daughter's eventual salvation.

This caution is particularly significant given that Elspet explains to [[Characters/Andreea Cohen\|Andreea]]: "As much as ye would do everything to protect and make certain Dumitru is safe, so do I for the one I care for. The army of the Order and the strongest churiphim and [[Characters/Judith\|Judith]] are upon us... Because of that, I must tread carefully." The fact that she specifically mentions [[Characters/Judith\|Judith]] alongside "the strongest churiphim" indicates that she views the first-rank as being in a category of her own.

### Other Supernatural Politics

The complex world of vampire and lilin politics sometimes puts her at odds with other powerful supernatural beings.

## Notable Locations

### Hollywood Hills Mansion

Elspet owns a mansion in the Hollywood Hills that serves as her primary residence. The mansion is:

- Magically warded against demons
- Home to her daughter Hannah
- A safe haven for those she protects
- Equipped with various magical protections

### Strip Clubs

Her three "Naked Sins" locations across Los Angeles serve as both business ventures and hunting grounds.

## Key Story Moments

### Battle with [[Characters/Mena Halifax\|Mena]] and Multiple High-Ranking Churiphim

One of Elspet's most impressive feats was her single-handed battle against **[[Characters/Mena Halifax\|Mena]]** (second-rank churiphim of the Order) and four other high-ranking churiphim simultaneously. During this epic confrontation:

- **The Setup:** Elspet faced off against [[Characters/Mena Halifax\|Mena]], Demeter, Aradia, Verena, and Catori - five of the Order's most powerful half-angels
- **Display of Power:** Elspet summoned hundreds of mirror images of herself and created crackling yellow discs that made deafening whistling sounds
- **Weather Control:** She turned the clouds red and created an orange globe of flames in the sky that shot down flaming spheres
- **Individual Combat:** Despite being outnumbered 5-to-1, Elspet systematically defeated each churiphim:
    - Cut Demeter in half at the legs
    - Drove her sword through Catori's chest
    - Used [[Characters/Mena Halifax\|Mena]] as a human shield against Aradia and Verena's attacks
    - Gutted Aradia and removed both of Verena's hands
    - Finally defeated [[Characters/Mena Halifax\|Mena]] by stabbing her through the heart and removing both her arms

This battle demonstrated that Elspet was individually more powerful than even the highest-ranking churiphim, establishing her as one of the most formidable supernatural beings in existence.

### Rescue of [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] from Crucifixion

Elspet performed a dramatic rescue when she saved [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] from torture and near-death:

- **The Situation:** [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] had been captured by hunters led by Samuel and was crucified (nailed to a cross) with over twenty stakes driven through her body
- **The Torture:** [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] was being tortured on "hallowed ground" and was near death from the extensive staking and blood loss
- **Elspet's Intervention:** Elspet appeared on the supposedly sacred ground (showing her immunity to holy protections), killed all of [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]'s torturers including brutally mutilating Samuel, and freed both [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] and Victor
- **The Rescue:** Elspet personally pulled out each of the twenty-plus stakes from [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]'s body, lifted her from the cross, and carried her through the sky to safety while [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] cried and clutched onto her "dark angel"
- **Aftermath:** Elspet nursed [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] back to health over several days, forcing blood into her mouth and caring for her like a mother

This rescue established a deep bond between Elspet and [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]], with [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] recognizing Elspet as her savior despite their previous conflicts.

### Battle with Invisible Demon

Elspet engaged in a significant battle with a powerful invisible demon that could bypass her protection enchantments, demonstrating both her vulnerabilities and her ability to adapt in combat.

### Confrontation with [[Characters/Leonette Alrick\|Leonette]]

A major battle with [[Ravenverse/The Churiphim\|the churiphim]] [[Characters/Leonette Alrick\|Leonette]] showcased Elspet's combat prowess and her willingness to show mercy when asked by allies.

### Protecting Amy

Elspet took on the protection of a young woman named Amy who was targeted by demons as a potential vessel, showing her commitment to protecting innocents.

### Saving [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] from [[Characters/Mena Halifax\|Mena]]'s Capture

Elspet rescued [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] when the second-rank churiphim [[Characters/Mena Halifax\|Mena]] had captured her during a solo hunt. Elspet appeared just as [[Characters/Mena Halifax\|Mena]] was about to take [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] prisoner, engaged [[Characters/Mena Halifax\|Mena]] in combat with golden spinning discs, and carried [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] to safety through the sky after creating a brilliant explosion in the forest.

## Quotes

_"A lilin, but if it helps ye, aye, a vampire."_

_"Nay, I am surely no hero."_ (When Hannah calls her a hero)

_"Boredom. And the girl looked savory. Her blood smelled magnificent."_ (Explaining her interference with demons)

_"I'm done with ye."_ (Before unleashing powerful magical attacks)

## Legacy and Impact

Elspet represents the complex nature of supernatural beings who exist between good and evil. While she feeds on humans and operates in morally grey areas, she consistently protects innocent people from greater supernatural threats. Her character demonstrates that power can be used for protection as well as predation, and that even ancient, potentially dangerous beings can form meaningful relationships and show genuine care for others.

Her role as both a mother figure and a formidable supernatural warrior makes her a unique character who bridges the gap between the human and supernatural worlds, serving as a protector of the innocent while maintaining her own darker nature as a lilin.
