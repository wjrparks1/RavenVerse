**James Deland** is a pivotal human character in [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]'s World series, serving as a vampire hunter for The Order of the Sons of Light during the American Revolution period (1776 series). His actions and legacy profoundly shaped the series' central narrative through his protection of Selah "[[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]" Walker and his descendants who continue to be protected by her into the present day.

## Biography

### Early Life and Personal Tragedy

James Deland's life was forever changed when his son **Joseph** was murdered by the vampire **Dumitru**, approximately twelve years before the main events of the 1776 series. This tragedy drove James into a personal vendetta to find and kill his son's murderer, leading him to discover the existence of vampires when he finally tracked down Dumitru.

During his attempt to avenge Joseph's death, James was saved by vampire hunters from The Order of the Sons of Light, who rescued him from becoming one of Dumitru's victims. This encounter led to his recruitment into the secret organization.

### Role in The Order of the Sons of Light

James became a **Leader of hunters for his territory** within The Order of the Sons of Light, a clandestine organization backed by the world's religious institutions that hunts demons and vampires. He worked alongside other notable hunters including:

- **Michael Wyman** (Leader of hunters for his territory)
- **Archer** (Head of Sons of Light in Western region)
- **Nathaniel Hughes** (Apprentice hunter)
- **Samuel** (Leader of hunters for his territory)

### Relationship with [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]

James's most significant contribution to the series was his complex relationship with **Selah "[[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]" Walker**, a second-generation vampire created by Jonas. After [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] was turned, James:

- **Captured and initially imprisoned her**, keeping her chained in his basement
- **Trained her as a vampire hunter**, teaching her to track and eliminate other vampires
- **Protected her from other hunters** who wanted to kill her, particularly Michael Wyman
- **Shaped her moral code**, instilling religious instruction and the principle to "never attack a godly person but rather, protect them from vampires and demons"
- **Gave her purpose** by having her hunt criminals and evil vampires rather than innocent humans

James used [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]'s unique abilities (she was unusually powerful for a second-generation vampire, possessing strength, speed, animal control, and telekinesis) to track down Dumitru and his growing vampire army.

### Family Life During the Revolutionary War

James maintained a family life during his hunting activities:

- **Wife**: Ann Deland
- **Children**: Multiple daughters including Ada (who suffered from nightmares), and at least one remaining son
- He struggled with balancing his need for vengeance against Dumitru with his family responsibilities

### Conflict with The Order and Departure

James's protection of [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] eventually put him at odds with The Order of the Sons of Light, who considered all undead evil. His final encounter with Michael Wyman came to a head when:

- **Wyman demanded immediate use of [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]** to track vampires, despite James insisting she needed more training
- **James struck Wyman** after he used Joseph's death as leverage, declaring he needed two more weeks
- **The Order later expelled James** after a failed mission against Dumitru that resulted in the deaths of most of Wyman's men

### The Promise and Legacy

Before departing from [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]'s life, James made a crucial decision that would span centuries:

- **He freed [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]** and provided her with a wagon for protection from sunlight during travel
- **He asked her to protect his family line**, a promise she accepted and has maintained for over 200 years
- **He left without explanation**, disappearing from [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]'s life but leaving an indelible impact on her moral development

## Historical Impact

### Immediate Consequences (1776 Era)

- **Lost Order Protection**: James's expulsion from The Order meant his family no longer had organizational protection
- **Dumitru's Threat**: The vampire promised to hunt down all of James's descendants and wipe them out
- **Personal Stakes**: James stayed close to home, living in constant fear for his remaining family's safety

### Long-term Legacy (Present Day)

James Deland's decision to protect [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] and ask for her reciprocal protection created a lasting covenant that spans generations:
