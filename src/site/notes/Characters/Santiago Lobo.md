**Santiago Lobo** is a major supporting character in [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]'s World series, serving as one of the twin dhampir (half-vampire, half-human) brothers who operate as paranormal investigators and vampire hunters in New Orleans during the early 1800s. Santiago is the more serious and skilled fighter of the Lobo twins, offering sanctuary to [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] and Elizabeth at his family mansion while maintaining a complex relationship with the supernatural world.

## Physical Description

Santiago is described as a **tall man dressed in fine attire**, with **long black hair tied at the nape of his neck**. Like his twin brother Domingo, Santiago is characterized as being **"charming and deathly handsome,"** possessing the kind of supernatural attractiveness that makes it easy to understand why women would fall for either twin.

Both brothers speak with **slight Spanish accents**, suggesting their Hispanic heritage, and maintain an aristocratic appearance befitting their wealthy plantation lifestyle in New Orleans.

## Biography

### Origins as a Dhampir

Santiago's unique nature stems from extraordinary circumstances during his birth. As he explains to [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]:

> "When our mother was bitten, the curse flowed into our blood. She gave birth to us during the transition from human to vampire. Our father took us far away. He knew our dark secret, but he couldn't bring himself to kill his sons."

This timing created the extremely rare dhampir condition - beings who possess the strengths of both vampires and humans while avoiding the weaknesses of either species.

### Early Life and Development

Santiago and his twin brother Domingo were **raised by their father** after their mother's transformation and disappearance. As they grew, they discovered their supernatural abilities:

- **Enhanced strength and speed** beyond human capability
- **Supernatural abilities** that set them apart from normal humans
- **Aging that slowed and eventually stopped** in their mid-twenties
- **Immunity to sunlight** and other traditional vampire weaknesses

Their father raised them despite knowing their "dark secret," unable to kill his own sons despite their supernatural nature.

### Loss of Mother

Their mother's fate remains a source of pain for both brothers, though Domingo claims nonchalantly that **"no one heard from her again. Probably killed by a hunter."** [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]] observes that despite Domingo's casual tone, his body language reveals this remains a deeply sensitive topic.

## Life in New Orleans

### Lobo Mansion

Santiago co-owns and operates an **immaculate mansion** featuring:

- **Vast, high beamed ceilings and dark wood floors**
- **Ornate mahogany furniture** with plush cushioned sofas and gold designs
- **Heavy drapery covering windows** (maintained for Elizabeth's vampiric needs)
- **Large fireplace** providing dim, warm lighting
- **Art collection** filling every corner

The mansion serves as both a luxurious home and a base of operations for their supernatural investigations.

### Relationship with [[Characters/Elizabeth Parks\|Elizabeth Parks]]

Santiago has known [[Characters/Elizabeth Parks\|Elizabeth Parks]] **"for a very long time"** and describes their relationship as complex but trusting. Despite his general hostility toward vampires, he accepts Elizabeth because:

- **She maintains a moral code**, feeding only on killers and murderers
- **She demonstrates good judgment** in assessing character
- **She provides valuable intelligence** about supernatural activities in New Orleans

Their relationship includes both friendship and occasional romantic tension, with Domingo noting Elizabeth's "infatuation" with newcomers like [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]].

## Professional Activities

### Paranormal Investigators

The Lobo brothers operate as **"investigators of the paranormal"** rather than traditional hunters, as Santiago explains:

> "Not witch hunters, more like investigators of the paranormal. Humans are plagued by evil be it demons, vampires, witches-- Or whatever else may lurk in the dead of night."

### Business Model

Their operation follows a specific pattern:

- **Reputation building**: "The Lobo twins" name has spread across regions plagued by supernatural problems
- **Selective clientele**: They work for those who have witnessed unexplained phenomena
- **No explanations policy**: "Those who hire us only know that when we launch an investigation and set out to solve the unexplained, their problems go away. We give no explanation, which is the agreement."
- **Maintaining secrecy**: "Who would believe a lone family or farmer?"

This approach allows them to help humans while maintaining the secrecy of the supernatural world.

### Anti-Vampire Operations

Santiago and Domingo **despise vampires** and actively hunt the predatory ones infesting New Orleans:

> "Santiago and Domingo kept a close watch. They despised vampires, and now they infested their beloved New Orleans. The Lobo brothers would slay the most sinister of the vampires and then disappear without a trace."

Their dhampir nature allows them to operate without detection, as **"the world of vampires and hunters were concerned, they believed Dhampirs to be nonexistent."**

## Combat Abilities and Skills

### Swordsmanship

Santiago is the **superior swordsman** of the twin brothers, demonstrating:

- **Fluid and agile technique** compared to Domingo's more direct style
- **Dual-wielding expertise** with saber and dagger
- **Dancing-like footwork** that makes his movement appear as choreographed combat
- **Exceptional speed** that can match even [[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]'s supernatural velocity

His fighting style is described as **"dancing"** - graceful, precise, and aesthetically impressive while remaining deadly effective.

### Dhampir Abilities

As a dhampir, Santiago possesses enhanced capabilities:

- **Supernatural strength and speed** beyond human limits
- **Immunity to sunlight** and traditional vampire weaknesses
- **Enhanced senses** for detecting supernatural threats
- **Rapid healing** - dhampir blood **"replenishing within a day"** when offered to vampires for feeding

### Tactical Intelligence

Santiago demonstrates strategic thinking in:

- **Assessing threats** quickly and accurately
- **Reading people and situations** with supernatural insight
- **Planning operations** that minimize risk to innocents
