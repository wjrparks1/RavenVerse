**Elizabeth Parks** is a major supporting character and love interest of Raven in the series, serving as one of the most morally complex and emotionally significant vampires in Raven's World. A third-generation vampire with a distinctive moral code and unique healing abilities, Elizabeth becomes Raven's closest companion and romantic partner during their time in New Orleans.

## Physical Description

Elizabeth is described as having **red hair and green eyes**, with a petite, delicate build that belies her vampiric strength. She is characterized by her vanity and attention to her appearance, often being "scrupulously" concerned with her clothing and presentation. She describes herself as "too delicate" for fighting and claims "the thought of getting blood on me is simply dreadful," though this is more about maintaining her fastidious nature than actual weakness.

## Biography

### Human Life and Transformation (1713)

Elizabeth's transformation into a vampire was born from tragedy and desperation. In **1713**, her entire family was slaughtered by Native American raiders who invaded their home in the middle of the night. Elizabeth was taken as a slave, enduring rape, abuse, and being worked nearly to death.

When she collapsed from exhaustion and faced continued beatings, an unnamed vampire appeared to her like "an angel" and presented her with a choice: **death or vengeance**. Elizabeth chose vampirism, seeing it as salvation from her torment.

### Early Vampire Years

Unlike many vampires who embrace predatory behavior, Elizabeth developed a strict moral code from her traumatic origins. She feeds exclusively on **murderers and killers**, taking pride in this selective hunting:

> "We all have our preferences. You may feed on whoever you want, but I feed on the blood of killers," Elizabeth said, lifting her chin proudly.

She demonstrates remarkable discipline in her feeding, insisting on proof of malicious intent before attacking: **"Always make sure of their intent."** This moral framework mirrors Raven's own ethical approach to vampirism.

### Life in New Orleans

#### Meeting Raven (Early 1800s)

Elizabeth first encounters Raven while both are hunting in New Orleans. Their meeting is memorable for Elizabeth's flirtatious and unconventional behavior - she **kisses Raven** during their first confrontation, immediately establishing her playful and romantically forward personality.

Initially mistaking Elizabeth for a threat to the Deland girls she was protecting, Raven discovers that Elizabeth was actually trying to warn them about a dangerous thief. This misunderstanding leads to their first hunt together, where Elizabeth demonstrates her methodical approach to hunting killers.

#### Residence at Lobo Mansion

Elizabeth lives at the **Lobo Mansion** with **Santiago and Domingo Lobo**, twin dhampirs (half-vampire, half-human) who hunt vampires in the New Orleans area. Despite the brothers' general hostility toward vampires, they accept Elizabeth due to her moral code and long-standing friendship.

The arrangement works because:

- **Elizabeth and Raven feed selectively** on criminals rather than innocents
- **The Lobo brothers can offer their blood** for sustenance when needed (dhampirs regenerate quickly)
- **All parties share a commitment** to protecting humans from predatory vampires

### Relationship with Raven

#### Romantic Development

Elizabeth's relationship with Raven evolves from initial attraction to deep, committed love. Elizabeth is the more forward of the two, consistently pursuing Raven despite her initial resistance:

> "Look at that one, I love the gold coloring." Raven pointed at the dress. "Yes, it would look wonderful on you, especially when I slowly peel it off you." Elizabeth grinned.

Their relationship deepens through:

- **Shared hunts** targeting criminals and evil vampires
- **Living together** at Lobo Mansion for years
- **Elizabeth's patient pursuit** of the emotionally guarded Raven
- **Mutual moral codes** that align their values

#### Commitment and Partnership

Elizabeth becomes the person who "filled the emptiness" in Raven's solitary existence. When circumstances force the group to leave New Orleans, Elizabeth chooses to follow Raven:

> "You admitted you love me, I'm not letting you get away that easily."

Their relationship represents one of the series' central emotional anchors, with Elizabeth serving as Raven's emotional confidant and romantic partner.

## Powers and Abilities

Unlike most vampires, Elizabeth has developed **partial sun immunity** well before the typical threshold:

> "Some vampires develop a tolerance to the sun after three hundred years, and I've heard others have experienced it at one hundred and fifty... I am beginning to bear short periods of sunlight occasionally."

At approximately 107 years of vampiric age, she can walk in sunlight for short periods, which is exceptionally early for this development.
