**Andreea Cohen** (also known as **Melissa Gray** in her modern identity) is a powerful vampire and former government assassin in WJR Parks' **Hidden World Series**. She serves as the protagonist of _Andreea The Undying_ and appears as a significant character in the first two _[[Characters/Raven Walker\|Raven]]_ novels.

## Biography

### Early Life (Pre-Vampire)

- **Born**: Late 1700s, London, England
- **Human Age at Turning**: 20 years old
- **Family Background**: Daughter of a well-known English nobleman
- **Turning Event**: Met vampire Dumitru on her 20th birthday while visiting a new theater with her father in London

### Vampiric Life

#### **Relationship with Dumitru** (1780s-1800s)

Andreea was turned by **Dumitru**, a powerful vampire who became obsessed with her innocent, child-like features and beauty. Three days after their meeting, she disappeared from London forever, transformed into one of the undead. Unlike many vampires, Andreea deeply loved Dumitru, though his feelings remained ambiguous - torn between genuine affection and seeing her as merely a companion in passion.

#### **Revolutionary War Period** (1780-1783)

During the American Revolutionary War, Andreea served as part of Dumitru's vampire army in his war against the Order of the Sons of Light. She demonstrated her unique ability to **control undead creatures**, commanding armies of zombies and ghouls in battle. This power proved extremely taxing, often leaving her unconscious from the mental strain.

#### **First Death and Resurrection** (Early 1800s)

Andreea was captured and brutally tortured by a **churiphim** (half-angel vampire hunter) with ice-silver eyes and storm-silver hair. [[Ravenverse/The Churiphim\|The churiphim]]:

- Hung Andreea from a tree by her remaining limb
- Slowly severed her limbs one by one
- Finally split her skull in two with a holy sword
- Left only burnt bones that were eventually buried

Her consciousness somehow survived in a "formless void" state, remaining aware near her remains for years. As battles were fought and blood soaked the earth around her bones, her body eventually regenerated, granting her a "second chance" at unlife.

### Modern Era (2000s-Present)

#### **Government Career**

After her resurrection, Andreea:

- Trained extensively in military combat, espionage, and weapons
- Became known as **"The Lotus"** - an elite government assassin
- Worked for the **[[Ravenverse/EMO\|EMO]] ([[Ravenverse/EMO\|Elite Missions Operations]])** black ops agency
- Adopted the identity **Melissa Gray**
- Followed a strict moral code: only killing those who deserved death

#### **The Sanderson Incident** (_Andreea The Undying_)

While on what she believed was a mission to eliminate a Russian spy, Andreea discovered she had been deceived. The target was actually **Dr. Kevin Alinsky**, a scientist trying to protect his mutated daughter. This led to:

- Andreea going rogue and protecting innocent civilians
- Discovering government experiments combining alien and human DNA
- Fighting an alien-human hybrid creature (the "a1")
- Forming a romantic relationship with **Sheriff [[Characters/Tucker Danvers\|Tucker Danvers]]**
- Being forced to eliminate **Agent Crowe** to protect her identity

**As a Human**: Innocent, child-like, and pure - described as having an "innocent child-like face" with large, round brown eyes

**Early Vampire Years**: Became a "vile beast" with no regard for human life, killing without thought or mercy, including children

**Modern Era**: Developed empathy and moral constraints, refusing to harm innocents and following a strict code of only killing those who deserve death

**Key Traits**:
